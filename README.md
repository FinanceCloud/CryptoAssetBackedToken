A transaction that uses a smart contract as described CryptoAssetBackedToken  would have many benefits. The effort to build up a standardized transaction could be reduced in terms of time and cost needed for legal and investment banking services. Third parties for asset reporting, calculation and trustee services are not needed, execution is certain, and the execution cost are negligible. The period of cash being trapped in the structure is reduced to a few minutes. In traditional transactions, it can take several weeks for an instalment received from a borrower to be allocated to investors. Cash does not have to be locked into bank accounts and is thereby not exposed to the risk that the bank is going into bankruptcy. Credit Asset Pool data can be queried directly from Digital assets Address(Owner,Wallet or Smart Contract) at any time; therefore, data quality is maximally reliable. Real time updates of high-quality asset performance data enable automated credit quality updates. The investor universe could be broadened, since micro investments are possible and reduced cost can enable smaller.
